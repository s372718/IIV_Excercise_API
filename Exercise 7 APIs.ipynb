    "Several interface (API) technologies have already been introduced in the exercise. One of the hardest things about APIs is understanding what they really are, as the concept is very abstract. Our examples use familiar services to show what is possible with different APIs. **The following exercise is about getting to know one of the technologies presented in the exercise**. To do this, we will explore some REST APIs of external services. We will try to analyse known platforms with regard to their interfaces and make an exemplary API call.\n",

    "The concept of APIs is transferable from the technologies presented here to other technologies (such as SOAP, etc.) and is only intended to convey a basic understanding of the topic. This is intended to convey the knowledge of how IT systems can be technically linked and to give a feeling for the effort involved in operating such interfaces.\n",

    "*Differentiation: The topic of interfaces also includes the development of interfaces in IT systems. In addition to the provision, the focus here is on the manipulation of data in the system as well as testing against various incorrect entries and IT security. The server side, i.e. the development of interfaces, is not covered in this exercise due to its complexity. In the following, we will therefore look at APIs from the client side, i.e. learn how to use existing REST interfaces to query or manipulate data and connect IT systems*"
